# Maxbot public
Some of Maxbot's code, now open source
(This does not contain the entire source code, just important parts which could be used for other projects)

Due to recent Discord API changes, most of Maxbot's message I/O handling code has been rewritten. As such, some sections of the code shown here may be outdated until next updated.
